//Played some games over my thanksgiving break so everything is like MMORPG guilds and factions inspired. VERY simple data table because I ran out of time but the
// database itself actually was meant to use two tables. I'm planning on doing the last two class files and their respective menu inputs over winter break to practice.\


//I removed my password from the DBConnection.java. Meant to add a scanner but ran out of time.
